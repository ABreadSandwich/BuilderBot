# BuilderBot
A program to build teams for Pokemon Showdown in the gen8nationaldexag format

use the config constant to tweak builder settings
add additional sets to sets.json
teams are exported in the console, so make sure debug mode is on and add a breakpoint anywhere in the program to access teams

######## TODO
- Improve logic to add checks for one threat at a time, instead of randomly chosing from a set.
